# Design Pattern
## SOLID
### S: single resonsibility principal: a class should have one, and only one reason, to change;
### O: open-closed principal: Software entities(class, cmodules, functions, etc.) shoudl be open for extension, but closed for modification.
### L: let phi(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. The phi(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
